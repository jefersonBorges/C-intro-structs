### Struct - Exercise

Develop a program, in which it is necessary to store the product of a sports store. The product has the following characteristics:
code (integer), description (text), price(float), promotion (yes or no).
To do so, create a struct called TipoProduto to store all the fields of a product.
Create a variable named product of type TipoProduto. Ask the user to register the values in the product variable. Display the values entered by the user on the screen.

  1. simple: Use only the struct
  2. functions: Using functions and structs
  3. functionsArray: use together functions, arrays and structs.
